# NFL_Data_206
NFL Data group project for CMSC 206 Spring 2021 at Montgomery College 
Data is from https://www.pro-football-reference.com/
Only contains my portion of the project

Manipulated data from previous NFL seasons using the python libraries: 
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib

to answer and visualize the questions:
- What team had the most passing yards in a season?
- What 5 teams had the most interceptions in a season?
- How does the number of passing yards a team has relate to a team's record in a season?
